  <h1>The National City of Sport</h1>

  <p>

  'National City of Sport', more commonly known as Sheffield.


</p>
<p>
  Sheffield was given the official title in 1995.
</p>
<p>This may come as a suprise to many, but not so much for the likes of Jessica Ennis and Danny Willett and Shaun Murphy, who are just some of the great sport personalities to come from the city.

  </p>
  <p>And aspiring to join their ranks our numerous members of the diving GB squad who train locally at Ponds Forge.</p>
  <p>
    The life of a professional athlete is somewhat of a mystery for the average person.
  </p>
  <p>
    But with the Olympics just around the corner, the frenzy around those competing will soon begin.
  </p>

  <p>
    So we ask, what is a day in the life of a potential Olympian like?
  </p>

  <p><h2><blockquote cite="http://">“I’m terrified."</h2></blockquote>

    <p>That was the reply Freddie Woodward gave when asked if he ever gets nervous.</p>
    <p>For the professional springboard diver, nerves are an everyday occurrence. </p>

<p>By the age of 20 he had been crowned National Champion four times, won a bronze medal at the 2014 Commonwealth Games and silver at the European Junior Championship.</p>
<p>The Sheffield-based Olympic hopeful is training six days a week, 25 to 30 hours per week, as he tries for a place at the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>





<p>His diving career began when he was talent-spotted in junior school.</p>
<p>
  His training began soon after with the hours increasing week by week.
</p>
<p>“All of my school friends have gone to university,” he says. Yet unlike his friends, Freddie spends his days at Ponds Forge, training full-time as a part of the GB squad.</p>
<p><blockquote cite="http://">
  <h4>"I wouldn’t do it if I didn’t like it.”</h4></p>

  <p>It is cold and very quiet; I have never seen the streets so empty. Little clouds of breath appear in front of my eyes; my hands have gone numb even though they are tucked in my pockets</p>
  <p>Luke and Amber both dream with going to the Olympics. However, unlike Freddie, they also have to deal with their university lives, studying economics and mechanical engineering respectively</p>
  <p>Luke Howdle is among Sheffield’s budding Olympic swimmers.<p/>
  <blockquote class="left">
  ‘I want to be the best - if that’s the best I can be, that’s fine.’ Luke
  </blockquote>
  <p>
  He has earned himself an impressive swimming portfolio. His recent achievements in swimming include coming third in the BUCS Short Course in November, and in the August Nationals he and his relay team set a new British record. He had even been the national champion for 18-year-olds. In year 11, Luke had been the England School Boy’s captain for swimming. </p>
  <p>As a student swimmer, Luke has grown accustomed to balancing his academic and athletic careers. </p>
    <p>From the age of six or seven, Luke’s parents signed him up for swimming lessons. Luke fondly recounts how his parents’ biggest fear was that their son wouldn’t know how to swim and drown. They hadn’t paid competitive swimming much attention - but as the lessons went on, Luke found himself spending more and more time in the pool as he got older
  </p>

  <p>
  To this day they have continued to support Luke, and he tells us that they have always been there to keep him levelheaded whenever he has felt emotional or impulsive.</p>

  <p>
  The student swimmer express gratitude for his parent’s supportive attitude, telling us that they never pushed him and that they wouldn’t mind if he decided to quit or if he wished to continue.</p>
  <p>
  The 21-year-old swimmer has a lot of pressure on him regarding his physique, as many athletes do.
  </p>
  <p>
  Luke recounts for us an incident before the Commonwealth Games when he had torn back muscles and had been unable to participate. As a result of being outside of the pool, he had gained weight as he had not stuck to his usual training diet and had no time to shed the extra weight.
  </p>

  <p>
  Though the Olympics would be a dream come true for Luke, he says that much like any other professional athlete, he’s happy simply knowing he’s given it his all, and pushed himself a little along the way.
  </p>
  <p>
  As important as competitions are, Luke tells us that the Olympics holds a certain prestige which other competitions lack, and that it is a keystone in one’s sporting career.
  </p>

  <p>
  He speaks with particular enthusiasm when speaking of getting a tattoo of the Olympic rings – a right only extended to Olympic athletes.
  </p>
  <p>
  Luke cited Michael Phelps to us when we asked him about who inspired him. He spoke with admiration about Phelps’ impressive track record, and praised both his swimming and training techniques.
  </p>

  <p>
  When he was younger, Luke trained for four years under a woman who had won two Olympic medals. He described her method of training as amazing, and he came to admire her dedication.
  </p>

  <p>
  Sheffield’s swim squad at Ponds Forge kept Luke determined as their cohesion and professionalism along with good sportsmanship and teamwork bred an ideal of how Luke thought the sport should be done.
  </p>
  <p>When asked about his social life, Luke joked that he doesn’t have one. </p>
  <p>
  Luke’s responsibilities as a competitive swimmer have swayed him away from the life of the archetypal student; he does not go on wild nights out, nor does he spend his weekends at the club. Mostly, the swimmer will grab a meal after a training session.
  </p>
  <figure class="swimming">

  </figure>
  <p>
  However, he mas managed to maintain balance between his swimming and academic careers. He reminisces about his school days and how understanding his teachers were whenever he arrived late to class.
  </p>
  <p>
  Academic departments have supported him immensely, as many times when Luke has been away to camps or competitions he has been unable to attend certain lectures. He advises us that any competitive sportsman or woman should find an institute willing to be supportive of both their academia and their sport.
  </p>
  <figure class="swimming">
  <img src="img/IMG_9547.JPG" alt="" />
  <figcaption>Freddie after recieving his medals.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
  In fact, his department has often recorded missed lectures for Luke to go over in his spare time.
  </p>

  <p>
  ‘Make sure you work hard, make sure you manage your time. Make sure you know what work you got to do and make sure you know when you get it done… You got to get the right balance.’

  On the other side of the Olympic medal is Amber Keegan, an ambitious 18-year-old competitive swimmer who has managed to represent Britain in the World Jr. Championships.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="left">
    ‘I think the dream would always be the Olympics – it’d be amazing if I could get there one day.’ Amber
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  She too is a student swimmer, and has had to juggle her academia alongside her swimming career. Amber trains six days a week with her busiest days including gym sessions as well as up to two swimming sessions in a single day
  </p>

  </figure>

  <p>
  The mechanical engineering student laughs a little nervously as she explains: ‘it’s a pretty hectic schedule.’
  </p>

  <p>
  She had, from an early age, been involved in a lot of sports – swimming specifically as she had attended lessons. Eventually, she found herself loving the pool more and more and found herself edging closer and closer to the world of competitive swimming.
  </p>
  <p>
    ‘I’ve always been crazy into swimming,’ Amber tells us.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 18-year-old’s progression is described as being slow since joining the county swim squad at the age of ten.
  </p>
  <p>
    In terms of her diet, Amber has dedicated herself to healthy eating, and does not regularly succumb to takeout. Her meals are subject to her timetable; she explains the importance of protein intake almost immediately after her training sessions, whilst busier days see Amber turning to carbs to keep her energized throughout the day.

<p>
  Ultimately, Sheffield is again finding its way as a leading sporting city.
</p>
<p>
  The city holds hope for those students vying for their spot in the world of professional swimming.
</p>
<p>
  And diving, whilst not the most obviously popular of sports is reaching new heights of fame.
</p>
<p>
  But combined, Sheffield and diving have found a harmonious togetherness and soon we hopefully see Sheffield once again in the limelight for sports as the diving GB squad reach for the OLympics.
